# Sliding-Window Genome Enrichment (DAVID)

This repository provides a Python script to perform **sliding-window functional enrichment** along a genome using the **[DAVID Bioinformatics Web Service](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)**.  
The script identifies enriched functional clusters by scanning consecutive windows of genes (in genome order) and retrieving term cluster reports from DAVID.

---

## ✨ Features
- Sliding-window scan of genome-ordered gene lists  
- Queries DAVID’s SOAP API for **functional term clusters**  
- Generates:
  - **Excel summary tables** (enrichment scores, p-values, cluster terms, sizes)  
  - **Per-window DAVID reports** as plain text  
  - **Bar plots** of enrichment scores and −log10(p-values)  

---

## 📦 Requirements
Python ≥ 3.9 with the following packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, suds-py3, openpyxl, tkinter

📥 Input

A text file containing Entrez Gene IDs (one per line), ordered according to their genomic positions.

▶️ Usage

Run the script (from Spyder or terminal). You will be prompted to:

Select the input file (gene IDs)

Select the output folder (results)

Enter a species short name (used in file naming)

📤 Output

Excel summary

<species>_DAVID_enrichment_<date>.xlsx

All Results sheet: full summary of every window

Filtered (Pval < 0.01) sheet: clusters passing the significance filter

Per-window reports

<window>_fullReport.txt

Figures

enrichment_scores.jpg (cluster 1 enrichment scores)

min_pvalues_log10.jpg (−log10 p-values for cluster 1)

⚙️ User Settings

At the top of the script, you can adjust:

WINDOW_SIZE – number of genes per window (default: 100)

STEP_SIZE – step size between windows (default: 25)

EMAIL – your registered DAVID email

WAIT_TIME – delay (s) between DAVID queries (default: 10)

DAVID_WSDL_URL and DAVID_ENDPOINT – DAVID web service URLs

⚠️ Limitations

Dependent on DAVID service availability and stability

SOAP API may throttle or fail under heavy use

Requires Entrez Gene IDs as input (not gene symbols)

📂 Example

See the Example/ folder for:

example_genes.txt – toy dataset of ordered Entrez IDs

Example output files (Excel + plots)
