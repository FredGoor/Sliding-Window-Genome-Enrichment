# Sliding-Window Genome Enrichment (DAVID)

This repository provides a Python script to perform **sliding-window functional enrichment** along a genome using the **[DAVID Bioinformatics Web Service](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/)**.  
The script identifies enriched functional clusters by scanning consecutive windows of genes (in genome order) and retrieving term cluster reports from DAVID.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Sliding-window scan of genome-ordered gene lists  
- Queries DAVID‚Äôs SOAP API for **functional term clusters**  
- Generates:
  - **Excel summary tables** (enrichment scores, p-values, cluster terms, sizes)  
  - **Per-window DAVID reports** as plain text  
  - **Bar plots** of enrichment scores and ‚àílog10(p-values)  

---

## üì¶ Requirements
Python ‚â• 3.9 with the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
suds-py3
openpyxl
tkinter # included in most Python installations


Install with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib suds-py3 openpyxl

üì• Input

A text file containing Entrez Gene IDs (one per line), ordered according to their genomic positions.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the script (from Spyder or terminal). You will be prompted to:

Select the input file (gene IDs)

Select the output folder (results)

Enter a species short name (used in file naming)

üì§ Output

Excel summary

<species>_DAVID_enrichment_<date>.xlsx

All Results sheet: full summary of every window

Filtered (Pval < 0.01) sheet: clusters passing the significance filter

Per-window reports

<window>_fullReport.txt

Figures

min_pvalues_log10.jpg (‚àílog10 p-values for cluster 1)

‚öôÔ∏è User Settings

At the top of the script, you can adjust:

WINDOW_SIZE ‚Äì number of genes per window (default: 100)

STEP_SIZE ‚Äì step size between windows (default: 25)

EMAIL ‚Äì your registered DAVID email

WAIT_TIME ‚Äì delay (s) between DAVID queries (default: 10)

DAVID_WSDL_URL and DAVID_ENDPOINT ‚Äì DAVID web service URLs

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Dependent on DAVID service availability and stability

SOAP API may throttle or fail under heavy use

Requires Entrez Gene IDs as input (not gene symbols)

üìÇ Example

See the Example/ folder for:

example_genes.txt ‚Äì toy dataset of ordered Entrez IDs

Example output files (Excel + plots)
